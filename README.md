# Mini Blockchain in Rust

A blockchain implementation built from scratch in Rust, focused on understanding the cryptographic primitives used in real networks like Solana and Bitcoin.

## Features

- **Block chain** — linked blocks via SHA-256 hashes, with full chain validation
- **Structured transactions** — each block contains a `Vec<Transaction>` with sender, receiver, amount, and individual signature
- **Ed25519 digital signatures** — blocks and transactions are signed independently; each transaction is signed by its sender's private key
- **Multiple signers** — each participant has their own keypair generated with `OsRng`, a cryptographically secure random number generator
- **Merkle tree** — transactions in each block are hashed using an iterative bottom-up Merkle tree; the Merkle Root is used in both block hashing and block signing
- **JSON persistence** — the chain can be saved to disk and loaded back with full integrity
- **CLI interface** — interact with the blockchain from the terminal using `clap`
- **REST API** — expose the blockchain over HTTP with `axum` and `tokio`; shared state across handlers via `Arc<Mutex<Blockchain>>`

## Cryptographic Primitives

| Primitive | Usage |
|---|---|
| SHA-256 (`sha2`) | Block hash, chain linking, Merkle tree nodes |
| Ed25519 (`ed25519-dalek`) | Transaction and block signing/verification |
| `OsRng` (`rand`) | Cryptographically secure key generation |

## How It Works

### Block structure

Each block contains:
- `index` — position in the chain
- `transacciones` — list of signed transactions
- `hash_previo` — hash of the previous block
- `hash` — SHA-256 of `index + merkle_root + hash_previo + timestamp`
- `timestamp` — Unix epoch seconds
- `firma` — Ed25519 signature of the block by its author
- `autor` — public key (32 bytes) of the block's signer

### Transaction structure

Each transaction contains:
- `sender` — public key of the sender (32 bytes, stored as hex in JSON)
- `receiver` — public key of the receiver (32 bytes, stored as hex in JSON)
- `amount` — amount transferred (`u64`)
- `firma` — Ed25519 signature of the transaction by the sender

### Merkle tree

Transactions within a block are hashed using an iterative bottom-up Merkle tree:

```
           Merkle Root
           [Hash(AB|CD)]
           /           \
     [Hash(AB)]      [Hash(CD)]
       /    \           /    \
  [Hash(A)] [Hash(B)] [Hash(C)] [Hash(D)]
      |         |         |         |
     tx1       tx2       tx3       tx4
```

Each leaf is the SHA-256 of a transaction's `sender + receiver + amount`. Pairs are concatenated and hashed level by level until one hash remains — the Merkle Root. If a level has an odd number of nodes, the last one is duplicated.

The Merkle Root is used in both `calcular_hash` and `firmar`, ensuring that any change to any transaction invalidates both the block hash and the block signature.

### Chain validation

`Blockchain::validar()` checks three things for every block:

1. The stored hash matches the recalculated hash (integrity)
2. `hash_previo` matches the actual hash of the previous block (chain linking)
3. If the block is signed, the Ed25519 signature is valid against the stored public key (authenticity)

## CLI Usage

```bash
# Generate a new wallet (saved to wallet.json)
cargo run --bin mini_blockchain -- new-wallet

# Send a transaction
cargo run --bin mini_blockchain -- send --from <sender_pubkey_hex> --to <receiver_pubkey_hex> --amount <amount>

# Show all blocks
cargo run --bin mini_blockchain -- show-chain

# Validate the chain
cargo run --bin mini_blockchain -- validate
```

## REST API

```bash
# Start the API server
cargo run --bin api
```

| Method | Endpoint        | Description                             |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/chain`        | Returns the full blockchain as JSON     |
| GET    | `/validate`     | Validates chain integrity               |
| GET    | `/block/:index` | Returns a specific block by index       |
| POST   | `/wallet`       | Generates a new wallet, returns pubkey  |
| POST   | `/send`         | Creates and signs a new transaction     |

### POST /send — Request body

```json
{
  "from": "<sender_pubkey_hex>",
  "to": "<receiver_pubkey_hex>",
  "amount": 100
}
```

### Example

```bash
# Generate a wallet
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/wallet

# Send a transaction
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/send \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"from":"<pubkey>","to":"<pubkey>","amount":100}'

# Inspect the chain
curl http://localhost:3000/chain

# Get a specific block
curl http://localhost:3000/block/0
```
